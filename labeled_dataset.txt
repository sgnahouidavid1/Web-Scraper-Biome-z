Biological  A Comparison of Homogenization vs. Enzymatic Lysis for Microbiome Profiling in Clinical Endoscopic Biopsy Tissue Samples Identification of the human microbiome has proven to be of utmost importance with the emerging role of bacteria in various physiological and pathological processes. High throughput sequencing strategies have evolved to assess the composition of the microbiome. To identify possible bias that may exist in the processing of tissue for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it is important to evaluate the extraction method on the overall microbial content and composition. Here we compare two different methods of extraction, homogenization versus enzymatic lysis, on gastric, esophageal and colorectal biopsies and survey the microbial content and composition using WGS and quantitative PCR (qPCR). We examined total bacterial content using universal 16S rDNA qPCR as well as the abundance of three phyla (Actinobacter, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes) and one genus (Fusobacterium). We found minimal differences between the two extraction methods in the overall community structure or in the abundance of specific clade. Furthermore, based on our qPCR analysis, neither method demonstrated preferential extraction of any particular clade of bacteria, nor significantly altered the detection of gram-positive or gram-negative organisms. However, although the overall microbial composition remained the same and the most prevalent bacteria could be detected effectively using either method, we demonstrate that the homogenization extraction method provides higher microbial DNA content and higher read counts from human tissue biopsy samples of the gastrointestinal tract.

Biological  Analysis of the X chromosome has been largely neglected in genetic studies mainly because of complex underlying biological mechanisms. On the other hand, the study of human microbiome data (typically over-dispersed counts with an excess of zeros) has generated great interest recently because of advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies. We propose a novel approach to infer the association between host genetic variants in the X-chromosome and microbiome data. The method accounts for random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), skewed (or nonrandom) XCI (XCI-S), and escape of XCI (XCI-E). The inference is performed through a finite mixture model (FMM), in which an indicator variable denoting the “true” biological mechanism is treated as missing data. An expectation-maximization algorithm on zero-inflated and two-part models is implemented to estimate genetic effects. We investigate the performance of the FMM along with strategies that assume XCI and XCI-E mechanisms for all subjects compared with alternative approaches. Briefly, an XCI mechanism codes males’ genotypes as homozygous females, whereas under XCI-E, males are treated as heterozygous females. By comprehensive simulations, we evaluate tests of the hypothesis under a computationally efficient score statistic. In summary, the FMM renders reduced bias and commensurate power compared to XCI, XCI-E, and alternative strategies while maintaining adequate Type 1 error control. The proposed method has far-reaching applications. In particular, we illustrate its usage on a large-scale human microbiome study, the Genetic, Environmental and Microbial (GEM) project, to test for the genetic association on the X chromosome.
Biological  Introduction Preterm birth (PTB) results from heterogeneous influences and is a major contributor to neonatal mortality and morbidity that continues to have adverse effects on infants beyond the neonatal period. This protocol describes the procedures to determine molecular signatures predictive of PTB through high-frequency sampling during pregnancy, at delivery and the postpartum period.Methods and analysis Four hundred first trimester pregnant women from either Myanmar or Thailand of either Karen or Burman ethnicity, with a viable, singleton pregnancy will be enrolled in this non-interventional, prospective pregnancy birth cohort study and will be followed through to the postpartum period. Fortnightly finger prick capillary blood sampling will allow the monitoring of genome-wide transcript abundance in whole blood. Collection of stool samples and vaginal swabs each trimester, at delivery and postpartum will allow monitoring of intestinal and vaginal microbial composition. In a nested case–control analysis, perturbations of transcript abundance in capillary blood as well as longitudinal changes of the gut, vaginal and oral microbiome will be compared between mothers giving birth to preterm and matched cases giving birth to term neonates. Placenta tissue of preterm and term neonates will be used to determine bacterial colonisation as well as for the establishment of coding and non-coding RNA profiles. In addition, RNA profiles of circulating, non-coding RNA in cord blood serum will be compared with those of maternal peripheral blood serum at time of delivery. Ethics and dissemination This research protocol that aims to detect perturbations in molecular trajectories preceding adverse pregnancy outcomes was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand (Ethics Reference: TMEC 15–062), the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (Ethics Reference: OxTREC: 33–15) and the local Tak Province Community Ethics Advisory Board. The results of this cooperative project will be disseminated in multiple publications staggered over time in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.
Biological  Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a perennial grass that inhabits sea cliffs of the Atlantic coasts of Europe. In this unhospitable environment plants grow in rock crevices and are exposed to abiotic stress factors such as low nutrient availability, wind, and salinity. Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a host of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae, which colonizes aerial organs, but its root mycobiota is unknown. The culturable endophytic mycobiota of FRP roots was surveyed in a set of 105 plants sampled at five populations in marine cliffs from the northern coast of Spain. In total, 135 different fungal taxa were identified, 17 of them occurred in more than 10% of plants and in two or more populations. Seven taxa belonging to Fusarium, Diaporthe, Helotiales, Drechslera, Slopeiomyces and Penicillium appeared to be constituents of the core microbiome of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa roots because they occurred in more than 20% of the plants analyzed, and at three or more populations. Most fungal strains analyzed (71.8%) were halotolerant. The presence of Epichloë festucae in aboveground tissue was detected in 65.7 % of the plants, but its presence did not seem to significantly affect the structure of the core or other root microbiota, when compared to that of plants free of this endophyte. When plants of the grass Lolium perenne were inoculated with fungal strains obtained from Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa roots, a Diaporthe strain significantly promoted leaf biomass production under normal and saline (200 mM NaCl) watering regimes. These results suggest that the core mycobiome of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa could have a role in host plant adaptation, and might be useful for the improvement of agricultural grasses.
Biological  Pesticide effects on microbial community structure and activity in soil are reviewed, showing that methodological developments within the past few years have generated new possibilities for assessing pesticide effects. The first example is the use of mRNA quantification showing that nitrification processes are indeed very susceptible to some pesticides, and that there is correlation between the mRNA transcript quantity and the nitrification rate. The second example is devoted to pesticides influencing microbial community structures. The emergence of high throughput sequencing techniques now allows a more detailed analysis of which bacterial species are influenced.
Biological  Background Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure has been associated with respiratory function decline in epidemiological studies. We hypothesize that a possible underlying mechanism is the perturbation of airway microbiome by PM exposure. Methods During October 2016–October 2017, on two human cohorts (n = 115 in total) in Shanghai China, we systematically collected three categories of data: (1) respiratory functions, (2) airway microbiome from sputum, and (3) PM2.5 (PM of ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) level in ambient air. We investigated the impact of PM2.5 on airway microbiome as well as the link between airway microbiome and respiratory functions using linear mixed regression models. Results The respiratory function of our primary interest includes forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1). FEV1/FVC, an important respiratory function trait and key diagnosis criterion of COPD, was significantly associated with airway bacteria load (p = 0.0038); and FEV1 was associated with airway microbiome profile (p = 0.013). Further, airway microbiome was significantly influenced by PM2.5 exposure (p = 4.48E-11). Conclusions To our knowledge, for the first time, we demonstrated the impact of PM2.5 on airway microbiome, and reported the link between airway microbiome and respiratory functions. The results expand our understanding on the scope of PM2.5 exposure's influence on human respiratory system, and point to novel etiological mechanism of PM2.5 exposure induced diseases.
Biological  The gut bacterial species, Akkermansia muciniphila is associated with a healthier clinical profile. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between A. muciniphila and glucose homeostasis in patients undergoing bariatric surgery (BS): gastric banding (GB) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This non-randomized prospective study included 65 women with severe obesity. Longitudinal analysis included subjects for whom A. muciniphila data was available at follow up (1, 3, and 12 months; GB (N=10) or RYGB (N=11)). Glucose homeostasis markers were measured under fasting or during an oral glucose tolerance test. Fecal microbiota was analyzed using shotgun metagenomics, and A. muciniphila relative abundance was assessed with 16S rRNA qPCR. A. muciniphila relative abundance was significantly lower in severe obesity (BMI mean (SD) 45.7 (5.4) kg/m2) than moderate obesity (33.2 (3.8) kg/m2) but not associated with glucose homeostasis markers. A significant increase in A. muciniphila relative abundance after RYGB was not correlated with metabolic improvement. Baseline A. muciniphila was correlated with bacterial gene richness and was highest in the high-richness Ruminococcaceae enterotype. A. muciniphila increased in relative abundance after BS in patients with low baseline A. muciniphila, especially those with a Bacteroides 2 enterotype classification. Although decreased in severe obesity, relative abundance of A. muciniphila was not associated with glucose homeostasis before or after BS. A certain level of A. muciniphila abundance might be required to observe a beneficial link to health. The severity of obesity and gut dysbiosis may partly explain the discrepancy with previous findings in less obese populations.
Biological  Background HIV-1 infection and physiological aging are independently linked to elevated systemic inflammation and changes in enteric microbial communities (dysbiosis). However, knowledge of the direct effect of HIV infection on the aging microbiome and potential links to systemic inflammation is lacking. Methods In a cross-sectional study of older people living with HIV (PLWH) (median age 61.5 years, N = 14) and uninfected controls (median 58 years, n = 22) we compared stool microbiota, levels of microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acid levels, SCFA) and systemic inflammatory biomarkers by HIV serostatus and age. Findings HIV and age were independently associated with distinct changes in the stool microbiome. For example, abundances of Enterobacter and Paraprevotella were higher and Eggerthella and Roseburia lower among PLWH compared to uninfected controls. Age-related microbiome changes also differed by HIV serostatus. Some bacteria with inflammatory potential (e.g. Escherichia) increased with age among PLWH, but not controls. Stool SCFA levels were similar between the two groups yet patterns of associations between individual microbial taxa and SCFA levels differed. Abundance of various genera including Escherichia and Bifidobacterium positively associated with inflammatory biomarkers (e.g. soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptors) among PLWH, but not among controls. Interpretation The age effect on the gut microbiome and associations between microbiota and microbial metabolites or systemic inflammation differed based on HIV serostatus, raising important implications for the impact of therapeutic interventions, dependent on HIV serostatus or age.
Biological  The intensive use of herbicides in agricultural soils of the Pampas region (Argentina) is a matter of environmental concern. We investigated the impacts of three widely used, post-emergence herbicides, glyphosate, 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and metsulfuron-methyl, on soil microbial communities by an integrated approach using short-term soil incubations. The key structural and functional parameters were estimated by culturable aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) density, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, and functional richness. Functional richness was evaluated as the proportion of carbon sources utilized in microplates containing various carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and aromatic compounds, and 1,3,5-triphenyiltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as redox dye. Three different soil types (Typic Argiudoll, Typic Haplustoll and Petrocalcic Paleustoll) were collected from agricultural fields with reported history of herbicide application. Soil microcosms were treated with one herbicide at a time at a dose 10 times higher than the recommended field application rates (glyphosate, 150mg a.i. kg−1; 2,4-D, 5mg a.i. kg−1; metsulfuron-methyl, 1mg a.i. kg−1soil) and incubated for up to 3 weeks. Metsulfuron-methyl had the least pronounced effects on soil microbial community. 2,4-D showed transient effects on soils, inhibiting either SIR or FDA and stimulating DHA. Several short-term effects of glyphosate on microbial activities and bacterial density were observed: (1) early stimulation of SIR and AHB; (2) dissimilar response in the soils for FDA and DHA; (3) transient increase in functional richness. To conclude, the addition of these herbicides at a dose 10 times higher than the normal field application rates caused minor changes to soil microbial activity, bacterial density and functional richness. The specific changes varied among herbicides, with the effects of glyphosate most pronounced.
Biological  The analysis of the lung microbiome composition is a field of research that recently emerged. It gained great interest in pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia since the microbiome seems to be involved in host immune responses, inflammation, and protection against pathogens. Thus, it is possible that the microbial communities living in the lungs play a role in the outcome and severity of lung infections such as Legionella-caused pneumonia and in the response to antibiotic therapy. In this chapter, all steps necessary for the characterization of the bacterial and fungal fraction of the lung microbiome using high-throughput sequencing approaches are explained, starting from the selection of clinical samples to the analysis of the taxonomic composition, diversity, and ecology of the microbiome.
Biological  Analysis of the relationship between the gut microbiome and dementia: a cross-sectional study conducted in Japan Dysregulation of the gut microbiome is associated with several life-threatening conditions and thus might represent a useful target for the prevention of dementia. However, the relationship between the gut microbial population and dementia has not yet been fully clarified. We recruited outpatients visiting our memory clinic to participate in this study. Information on patient demographics, risk factors, and activities of daily living was collected, and cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fecal samples were obtained, and the gut microbiome was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, one of the most well-established and reliable 16S ribosomal RNA-based methods for classifying gut microbiota. Patients were divided into two groups, demented and non-demented. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the variables independently associated with dementia. The T-RFLP analysis revealed differences in the composition of the gut microbiome: the number of Bacteroides (enterotype I) was lower and the number of ‘other’ bacteria (enterotype III) was higher in demented than non-demented patients. Multivariable analyses showed that the populations of enterotype I and enterotype III bacteria were strongly associated with dementia, independent of the traditional dementia biomarkers. Further studies of the metabolites of gut microbes are needed to determine the mechanism underlying this association.
Biological  Association of prevalent vaginal microbiome of mother with occurrence of type I diabetes in child Type I diabetes (T1D) is a rapidly increasing autoimmune disease especially in the Western countries and poses a serious global health problem. Incidence of T1D cannot be fully explained by genetic background, and environmental factors have been assumed to play a role. Environmental conditions and composition of human microbiome have been found to correlate with the incidence of T1D. We asked whether mothers’ prevalent vaginal microbiome could correlate with the incidence of T1D in child. To test this hypothesis, we collected samples of vaginal microbiomes from eight mothers that had at least one child with T1D (child age maximum of 11 years at the time of sampling), born with a vaginal delivery. Eight control mothers had child/children with vaginal delivery and no diabetic child/children. The microbiomes were studied by using 16S rRNA Ion Torrent high throughput sequencing. We found that composition of total and Lactobacillus microbiome was altered, and saw an indication that diversity of vaginal microbiomes of the mothers with a diabetic child could be higher. Based on these pilot observations, we strongly encourage a larger population study to verify whether mother vaginal microbiome diversity and composition are linked to the prevalence of T1D in children.
Biological  Bacterial community structure and effects of picornavirus infection on the anterior nares microbiome in early childhood Background: Little is known regarding the nasal microbiome in early childhood and the impact of respiratory infection on the infants' nasal microbial composition. Here we investigated the temporal dynamics and diversity of the bacterial composition in the anterior nares in children attending daycare centers.; Results: For our investigation, we considered 76 parental-taken nasal swabs of 26 children (aged 13 to 36 months) collected over a study period of 3 months. Overall, there was no significant age-specific effect or seasonal shift in the nasal bacterial community structure. In a sub-sample of 14 healthy children the relative abundance of individual taxa as well as the overall diversity did not reveal relevant changes, indicating a stable community structure over the entire study period. Moreover, the nasal bacterial profiles clustered subject-specific with Bray-Curtis similarities being elevated in intra-subject calculations compared to between-subject calculations. The remaining subset of 12 children provided samples taken during picornavirus infection (PVI) and either before or after a PVI. We detected an association between the relative abundance of members of the genus Streptococcus and PV when comparing both (i) samples taken during PVI with samples out of 14 healthy children and (ii) samples taken during PVI with samples taken after PVI within the same individual. In addition, the diversity was higher during PVI than after infection.; Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a personalized structure of the nasal bacterial community is established already in early childhood and could be detected over a timeframe of 3 months. Studies following infants over a longer time with frequent swab sampling would allow investigating whether certain parameter of the bacterial community, such as the temporal variability, could be related to viral infection.;
Biological  Belowground biodiversity and ecosystem functioning Evidence is mounting that the immense diversity of microorganisms and animals that live belowground contributes significantly to shaping aboveground biodiversity and the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Our understanding of how this belowground biodiversity is distributed, and how it regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, is rapidly growing. Evidence also points to soil biodiversity as having a key role in determining the ecological and evolutionary responses of terrestrial ecosystems to current and future environmental change. Here we review recent progress and propose avenues for further research in this field.
Biological  Bi-directional drug-microbiome interactions of anti-diabetics Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a global epidemic. Although several drugs are available to manage T2D, problems associated with person-to-person variability in drug efficacy and potential side-effects remain unresolved. Owing to the emerging role of the gut microbiome in obesity and T2D, the interaction between gut microbes and anti-diabetic drugs and its influence on drugs' functions remains of immediate research interest. On one hand, drugs can manipulate gut microbiome composition and metabolic capacity. Conversely, the metabolic activities of the microbiome and its metabolites can also influence drug metabolism and effects. Hence, understanding this bi-directional drug-microbiome interaction and how it influences the clinical outcomes of antidiabetic drugs can pave the way to develop next-generation strategies to ameliorate diabetes. This review presents evidences demonstrating the putative interactions between anti-diabetic drugs and the gut microbiome, and discusses the potential of microbiome modulators to manipulate drug-microbiome interactions and the drug metabolism.
Biological  Birth mode is associated with earliest strain-conferred gut microbiome functions and immunostimulatory potential The rate of caesarean section delivery (CSD) is increasing worldwide. It remains unclear whether disruption of mother-to-neonate transmission of microbiota through CSD occurs and whether it affects human physiology. Here we perform metagenomic analysis of earliest gut microbial community structures and functions. We identify differences in encoded functions between microbiomes of vaginally delivered (VD) and CSD neonates. Several functional pathways are over-represented in VD neonates, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. We link these enriched functions to individual-specific strains, which are transmitted from mothers to neonates in case of VD. The stimulation of primary human immune cells with LPS isolated from early stool samples of VD neonates results in higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). Accordingly, the observed levels of TNF-α and IL-18 in neonatal blood plasma are higher after VD. Taken together, our results support that CSD disrupts mother-to-neonate transmission of specific microbial strains, linked functional repertoires and immune-stimulatory potential during a critical window for neonatal immune system priming.
Biological  Comparative metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses reveal the breed effect on the rumen microbiome and its associations with feed efficiency in beef cattle Microorganisms are responsible for fermentation within the rumen and have been reported to contribute to the variation in feed efficiency of cattle. However, to what extent the breed affects the rumen microbiome and its association with host feed efficiency is unknown. Here, rumen microbiomes of beef cattle (n = 48) from three breeds (Angus, Charolais, Kinsella composite hybrid) with high and low feed efficiency were explored using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, aiming to identify differences between functional potentials and activities of same rumen microbiomes and to evaluate the effects of host breed and feed efficiency on the rumen microbiome.
Biological  Comparison of the oral microbiome of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis and periodontitis-free subjects Objective The primary objectives of the study were to assess differences in complex subgingival bacterial composition between periodontitis-free persons and patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gAgP). Background The composition of the oral microbiota plays an important role for both oral and systemic diseases. However, the complex nature of the oral microbiome and its homeostasis is still poorly understood. Material and methods We compared the microbiome of 13 periodontitis-free persons to 13 patients with gAgP. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, targeting the V3/V4 region using the MiSeq platform. Results In total, 1713 different bacterial species were mapped according to the Greengenes database. Using the Shannon index, no significant differences in alpha diversity were found between the two study groups. In principal component and linear discriminant analyses, disease-specific differences in beta diversity of the microbiome composition were evaluated. Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Synergistetes were more abundant in gAgP whereas Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were associated with a healthy periodontium. At the bacterial species level, we showed that Porphyromonas gingivalis is the strongest indicator of gAgP. Treponema denticola and Tanerella forsythia of the “red complex” as well as Filifactor alocis were among the ten best biomarkers for gAgP. Conclusions These results broaden our knowledge of disease-specific differences in the microbial community associated with generalized AgP. A more complex view of the composition of the oral microbiome describes the etiology of generalized AgP in more detail. These results could help to individually adapt periodontal therapy in these patients.
Biological  Cross-Domain and Viral Interactions in the Microbiome The importance of the microbiome to human health is increasingly recognized and has become a major focus of recent research. However, much of the work has focused on a few aspects, particularly the bacterial component of the microbiome, most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract. Yet humans and other animals can be colonized by a wide array of organisms spanning all domains of life, including bacteria and archaea, unicellular eukaryotes such as fungi, multicellular eukaryotes such as helminths, and viruses. As they share the same host niches, they can compete with, synergize with, and antagonize each other, with potential impacts on their host. Here, we discuss these major groups making up the human microbiome, with a focus on how they interact with each other and their multicellular host.
